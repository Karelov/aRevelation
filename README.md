Android password manager based on Revelation Password Manager file format.

Introduction
===========
Hello!
This project is android implementation of Revelation password manager. Right now it is in it's prototype life stage. I find it very easy to use this password manager with Dropbox or another sync software and I find it very hard to use it without android application. This is the main reason of this app development. If you have any questions/suggestions please mail me to alexey.kislin@gmail.com.

===========
1. Download android SDK.
2. Go to "<android-sdk>/tools".
3. Run "./android update sdk --no-ui".
4. Run "./android update project --target <targetID> --path <path to the project folder>".
5. Go to the path of the project and run "ant release".
6. The project will be built in "<path to the project folder>/out".
